# Rest_API_vulnerable_apps

This is the basic REST API vulnerable App, where you will find 3 app.py. Each of them contains different structure.

app1.py: Its a basic app, which doesn't support any hashing or encrypting.
app2.py: It supports id hashing,
app3.py: It supports token based authentication.

To run this enviroment, you just need to run:-

`python3 app1.py`

And that will run on `127.0.0.1:5000` go to browser.

Actually I will work on this app to make it functional with basic routing.
